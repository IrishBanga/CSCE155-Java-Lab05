This lab introduces the use methods and informal unit testing.

## Prior to Lab

* Read and familiarize yourself with this handout.
* Read the required chapters(s) of the textbook as
  outlined in the course schedule.

## Peer Programming Pair-Up

***For students in online section(s):*** you may complete
the lab on your own if you wish or you may team up with a partner
of your choosing, or, you may consult with a lab instructor to get
teamed up online (via Zoom).

***For students in the on campus section:*** your lab instructor
may team you up with a partner.  

To encourage collaboration and a team environment, labs are be
structured in a *peer programming* setup.  At the start of
each lab, you will be randomly paired up with another student
(conflicts such as absences will be dealt with by the lab instructor).
One of you will be designated the *driver* and the other
the *navigator*.  

The navigator will be responsible for reading the instructions and
telling the driver what to do next.  The driver will be in charge of the
keyboard and workstation.  Both driver and navigator are responsible
for suggesting fixes and solutions together.  Neither the navigator
nor the driver is "in charge."  Beyond your immediate pairing, you
are encouraged to help and interact and with other pairs in the lab.

Each week you should alternate: if you were a driver last week,
be a navigator next, etc.  Resolve any issues (you were both drivers
last week) within your pair.  Ask the lab instructor to resolve issues
only when you cannot come to a consensus.  

Because of the peer programming setup of labs, it is absolutely
essential that you complete any pre-lab activities and familiarize
yourself with the handouts prior to coming to lab.  Failure to do
so will negatively impact your ability to collaborate and work with
others which may mean that you will not be able to complete the
lab.  

# Lab Objectives & Topics

At the end of this lab you should be familiar with the following:

-   Understand how to design, document, write, and use methods in Java

-   Design test cases and write informal unit tests

# Background

Most programming languages allow you to define and use functions (or
methods). Functions *encapsulate* functionality into a unit of code that
can be reused. A function can be specified to take any number of inputs
(called parameters or arguments) and return an output. Defining and
using functions has several advantages. First, it facilitates code
reuse. Rather than cutting and pasting a block of code, it can be
encapsulated into a function and reused by calling the function anytime
it needs to be executed.

Second, functions facilitate *procedural abstraction*. Often, we don't
care or need to worry about the implementation details of a certain
algorithm or procedure. By encapsulating the details in a function, we
only need to know how to use it (what inputs to provide it and what
output we can expect from it). We don't need to worry about *how* it
computes its result. For example, up to now you've been using the
standard math library's function to compute the square root of a number
$x$, but you haven't had to worry about the details of how this
computation actually takes place.

Finally, functions naturally define a *unit* of code that can be easily
tested. Typically, unit tests are designed with *test cases* which are
input/output combinations that are known to be correct. Unit testing
involves feeding the input to a function and comparing the output to the
*expected* output. If they match, we say the test case *passes*, if not,
we say it *fails*. Unit testing gives a higher level of confidence that
our function's implementation is correct.

When defining a function, it is necessary to declare its *signature*.
The signature of a function includes:

-   The function's identifier -- its name

-   The return type -- the type of variable the function returns

-   The parameter list -- the number of parameters the function takes
    (also called its *arity*) along with their types

## Methods in Java

In Java, functions (usually called methods) must be declared/defined
within a `class`.  This is done by declaring the method's signature and
adding a block of code that specifies the instructions that will be executed
when the method is *invoked* or "called".  In addition, there are two
modifiers that can be applied to methods:

  - `public` -- this specifies that the method is publicly visible
    and can be invoked by any other method.  Alternatives include
    `private` (the method is only visible within the class) and
    `protected` (the method is visible within the class and any
    subclasses)

  - `static` -- this specifies that the method belongs to the class
    and not to instances of the class.  Generally, you call a `static`
    method using the class name followed by the "dot" operator:
    `Math.sqrt(2.0)`

# Activities

We have provided partially completed programs for each of the following
activities. Clone the lab's code from GitHub using the following URL:
<https://github.com/cbourke/CSCE155-Java-Lab05>.

## Writing Functions

Images are made up of individual *pixels*. Each pixel can be represented
using an RGB (red-blue-green) color scheme. RGB is generally used in
displays and models a color with three integer values in the range
$[0, 255]$ corresponding to the red, green and blue "contribution" to
the color. For example, the triple $(255, 255, 0)$ corresponds to a full
red and green (additive) value which results in yellow.

Two common image filters are a black-and-white filter which transforms
an image into an equivalent gray-scale image, and a sepia filter which
transforms a photo to a reddish-brown monochrome to give it an old-timey
look.

We have already written a substantial program that processes an image
file and applies one of these filters. However, you will need to write
the functions responsible for transforming an RGB value into a
gray-scale or sepia RGB value.

To convert an RGB value to gray-scale you can use one of several
different techniques. Each technique "removes" the color value by
setting all three RGB values to the same value but each technique does
so in a slightly different way.

The first technique is to simply take the average of all three values:
$$\frac{r + g + b}{3}$$

The second technique, known as the "lightness" technique averages the
most prominent and least prominent colors:
$$\frac{\max\{r, g, b\} + \min\{r, g, b\}}{2}$$

The luminosity technique uses a weighted average to account for a human
perceptual preference toward green, setting all three values to:
$$0.21 r + 0.72 g + 0.07 b$$

**Note**: in all three cases, the final value should be *rounded* before
being returned (*not* truncated).

A sepia filter sets different values to each of the three RGB components
using the following formulas. Given a current $(r,g,b)$ value, the sepia
tone RGB value, $(r',g',b')$ would be:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
  r' &= 0.393r + 0.769g + 0.189b \\
  g' &= 0.349r + 0.686g + 0.168b \\
  b' &= 0.272r + 0.534g + 0.131b
\end{array}$$

As with the gray-scale techniques, the final values should
be rounded. Moreover, if any of the values exceeds 255, they should be
reset to 255 to stay within the valid RGB color range.

### Instructions

In this exercise, you will design and write a "color utilities" library
by implementing the methods described below. We've provided a class,
`ColorUtils.java` with a few methods already completed for you. You'll
place your methods in the same class.

-   Run the `ColorUtilsTester.java` file which contains several
    informal unit tests for the methods in `ColorUtils.java`. Observe
    that one of the tests will fail. Fix the `toGrayScaleAverage()`
    method so that it passes the test. Use this as an opportunity to
    observe:

    -   How to use the `RGB` class

    -   How methods are defined in Java

    -   How methods are documented in Java

    Be sure to write doc-style documentation for all of the following
    methods.

-   Write a helper method that returns the *minimum* of 3 integers. Name
    your function `min`.

-   Write a method that takes an `RGB` value and uses the
    lightness technique to return the gray-scale `RGB` value.
    Name your method `toGrayScaleLightness()`

-   Write a method that takes an `RGB()` value and uses the
    luminosity technique to return the gray-scale `RGB()` value.
    Name your method `toGrayScaleLuminosity()`

-   Write a method that takes an `RGB` value and computes a
    sepia-tone `RGB` value. Name your method `toSepia()`.

-   Write javadoc-style documentation for all your functions.

## Ad-Hoc Testing

We've provided an application interface (see `ImageDriver.java` that
loads and saves images specified as *command line arguments*.

-   You only need to specify the file names

-   It is assumed the files are in the `images` directory

-   The output file will be in the same directory, you may need to
    *refresh* your project in Eclipse if they do not show up
    automatically

The program uses your methods to convert the image and save it to a new
file.

Do some *ad-hoc testing* using this application: convert the images
provided as part of the project and view the results. You can also try
converting some of your own images. If your functions are correct, the
image conversion should look something like the following:

![Memorial Stadium](./images/memorialStadium.jpg)
![Old-Timey Memorial Stadium](./images/memorialStadiumSepia.jpg)

## Writing Tests

Testing is a fundamental step in software development. The most common
types of tests are *unit tests* and the most common "unit" is a
function. You may have already "tested" your functions by running the
project and viewing the resulting images. However, for your final
activity, you will write (informal) *automated* unit tests to test your
functions more rigorously.

Some starter unit testing code has already been provided in
`ColorUtilsTester.java`. Each block of code calls a function with some
inputs and compares the return value to the *expected* output. If they
match, the test passes, if not it fails. A message is printed to the
user and the total number of passed/failed test cases is reported.

Using this starter code as an example, add more test cases for the other
functions. You should write *at least* 1 test case for *each* function you
wrote for a total of 18.
