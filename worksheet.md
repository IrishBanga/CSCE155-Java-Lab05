# Lab 5.0 - Worksheet

Name(s) and Login(s):



1. Use `OrderStatistic.java` to answer the following questions.

a.	Identify all of the user-defined methods in the program along 
with the functions' return types and the number of parameters they 
accept.



b.	Among the methods `main`, `strToIntArray`, `insertionSort`, and 
`getOrderStatistic`: identify which methods calls which other methods(s).



c.	To compute the minimum element you would ask for the first element 
(`i = 1`).  What arguments would you need to provide to generate the second 
smallest element?  The maximum element?  The median element?



3.	Assume you had written the force method like 

```java
getForce(double distance, double time, double initialDistance, double mass) { 

  return mass * getAcceleration(distance, initialDistance, time);
}
```

Compare the two different methods of writing this function: which one
is better for reusability?  Readability?  Why?.
